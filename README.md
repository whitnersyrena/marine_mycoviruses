### Abstract
Nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) are ancient associates of eukaryotes whose endogenized remnants are increasingly recognized as drivers of genome evolution. In this study, we identified NCLDV-like endogenous viral elements in 18 marine Ascomycota fungi isolates from Hawaiian coastal waters. Across viral-bearing contigs, we recovered a diverse set of canonical NCLDV hallmark genes co-localized with auxiliary metabolic and regulatory genes (AMGs). These AMGs, including glycosyltransferases, serine/threonine and F10-like kinases, and short-chain dehydrogenases, suggest that the ancestral viruses encoded pathways influencing carbon metabolism and redox balance in their fungal hosts. The additional recovery of genes such as mRNA capping enzymes and ribonucleotide reductases suggests these viruses were once highly autonomous and contained machinery to support replication independent of the fungal host. The intronization of these genes within fungal scaffolds further supports the potential functional assimilation following endogenization. Phylogenetic and cophylogenetic analyses place these elements as sister to the Mycodnaviridae, supporting a long-standing shared evolutionary history between fungi and NCLDV viruses and pointing to an unrecognized contribution of these viral lineages to fungal genome diversification.
